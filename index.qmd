## Welcome

This site hosts PCA plots, LD heatmaps, and LD network visualizations for major linkage disequilibrium (LD) clusters in *Saccharina latissima*.

It is intended as a browsable companion to genomic analyses of sugar kelp population structure and local adaptation.

## What you’ll eventually find here

-   PCA plots for each LD cluster
-   LD heatmaps by scaffold and genomic window
-   LD network visualizations
-   Functional and molecular annotations
-   Searchable tables linking function to genomic regions

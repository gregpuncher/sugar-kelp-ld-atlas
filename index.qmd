The Sugar Kelp LD Atlas is an interactive web resource for exploring genomic structure and linkage disequilibrium architecture in *Saccharina latissima*. It was developed to accompany population genomic analyses of sugar kelp and to provide an accessible, high-resolution view of multilocus patterns that are difficult to convey in static figures.

Users can browse individual LD clusters, examine ordination and network structure, and connect statistical signals to functional genomic context.

### What this atlas provides

-    Cluster-specific **PCA plots** revealing patterns of genetic structure

-    **LD heatmaps** across scaffolds and genomic windows

-    **LD networks** highlighting linkage architecture and connectivity

-    **Partial RDAs** evaluating genotype–environment and genotype–phenotype associations

-    **Functional annotations** of genes contained within LD blocks

-   **Searchable tables** linking genomic regions to annotated biological functions

This site is intended as both a companion to published analyses and a standalone exploratory tool for understanding the genomic basis of population structure and adaptation in sugar kelp.

### How to use this site

This site is designed for interactive exploration of genomic structure across linkage disequilibrium (LD) clusters in *Saccharina latissima*.

-   Use the **navigation menu** to browse results by genomic region or functional category.\
-   The **search bar** allows keyword-based searches across gene annotations, scaffolds, and LD clusters.\
-   **Interactive tables** can be sorted, filtered, and searched to identify genomic regions of interest.\
-   Clicking a cluster opens a dedicated page containing **PCA plots**, **LD heatmaps**, **LD networks**, and **partial RDA results** for that region.\
-   Figures are interactive where applicable and can be inspected in detail to explore patterns of linkage, structure, and association.

The atlas is intended to complement static figures and tables by enabling detailed, region-specific inspection of results.

Note: A full citation should accompany any published analyses making use of this resource.

## Browse clusters

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)

clusters <- readr::read_csv("data/clusters_metadata.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(
    cluster_id = as.character(cluster_id),
    cluster_page = paste0("clusters/cluster_", cluster_id, ".html"),
    Region = paste0(start_bp, "–", end_bp),
    Cluster = sprintf('<a href="%s">%s</a>', cluster_page, cluster_id)
  ) %>%
  arrange(scaffold, start_bp) %>%
  select(
    Scaffold = scaffold,
    Cluster,
    `Region (bp)` = Region,
    `# SNPs` = n_snps
  )

DT::datatable(
  clusters,
  escape = FALSE,
  rownames = FALSE,
  options = list(pageLength = 25, autoWidth = TRUE)
